## History

This is a program I wrote for the Palm Pilot which selects a random set of Mario Kart 64 tracks. We
played a lot of Mario Kart 64 back in the day and had a Perl script to do this, but I figured it
would be fun and easy to be able to do it with my fancy schmancy Palm Pilot instead of walking over
to the computer.
